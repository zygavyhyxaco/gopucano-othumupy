Overview
Varney&#039;s Midwifery continues to be the gold standard for midwifery practice in an updated seventh edition. New lead editors assembled a team of expert contributors and authors to continue the legacy of Varney&#039;s Midwifery as the trusted, must-have resource for students, professional midwives, and women&#039;s health practitioners. Varney&#039;s Midwifery uses current evidence-based guidelines to address the care of individuals throughout the lifespan, including primary care, gynecology, perinatal care in a variety of settings, and newborn care. The Seventh Edition reflects the new ACNM Core Competencies for Basic Midwifery Practice published in 2020, including care of transgender individuals and abortion-related care. It also provides updated information on promotion of health equity, new techniques for fetal screening, diagnosis across the lifespan, and chronic conditions in pregnancy.
