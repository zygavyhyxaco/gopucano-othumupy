Overview
Diana Gabaldonâ€™s brilliant storytelling has captivated millions of readers in her bestselling and award-winning Outlander saga. Now, in her first-ever graphic novel, Gabaldon gives readers a fresh look at the events of the original Outlander: Jamie Fraserâ€™s side of the story, gorgeously rendered by artist Hoang Nguyen.


After too long an absence, Jamie Fraser is coming home to Scotlandâ€”but not without great trepidation. Though his beloved godfather, Murtagh, promised Jamieâ€™s late parents heâ€™d watch over their brash son, making good on that vow will be no easy task. Thereâ€™s already a fat bounty on the young exileâ€™s head, courtesy of Captain Black Jack Randall, the sadistic British officer whoâ€™s crossed pathsâ€”and swordsâ€”with Jamie in the past. And in the court of the mighty MacKenzie clan, Jamie is a pawn in the power struggle between his uncles: aging chieftain Colum, who demands his nephewâ€™s loyaltyâ€”or his lifeâ€”and Dougal, war chieftain of Clan MacKenzie, whoâ€™d sooner see Jamie put to the sword than anointed Columâ€™s heir.
And then there is Claire Randallâ€”mysterious, beautiful, and strong-willed, who appears in Jamieâ€™s life to stir his 
compassion . . . and arouse his desire.



But even as Jamieâ€™s heart draws him to Claire, Murtagh is certain sheâ€™s been sent by the Old Ones, and Captain Randall accuses her of being a spy. Claire clearly has something to hide, though Jamie canâ€™t believe she could pose him any danger. Still, he knows she is torn between two choicesâ€”a life with him, and whatever it is that draws her thoughts so often elsewhere.





Step into the captivating, passionate, and suspenseful world of The Exile, and experience the storytelling magic of Diana Gabaldon as never before.
