For everyone whoâ€™s ever felt too big, too weird, too queerâ€”or just too muchâ€”comes a happily ever after for the rest of us. Hollywood isnâ€™t nice to women like Diana Smith, but that hasnâ€™t stopped her from being unabashedly queer, plus-sized, and determined to make award-winning movies that showcase the diversity of her community. She was so close to her goal, appearing at festivals and gaining attention for her short films, when grief came and shattered Dianaâ€™s directorial dreams. Forced to move to the suburbs with her sister and kids, the closest thing Diana gets to the movies these days is dressing the stars of them at her high-end department store job. Until one day, she gets a pity invite to a gala full of Hollywoodâ€™s most elite, where she unwittingly attracts the attention of a famous action star. The unexpected pairing shocks their friendsâ€“and the tabloidsâ€“forcing Diana to choose between the status quo and the silver screen. For the first time in her life, doors open for Diana and the possibilities seem endless. The chance to create unforgettable films. To shake up the industry. To inspire everyone whoâ€™s ever felt like they didnâ€™t belong. But fame always comes with a costâ€¦and to get her Hollywood ending, Dianaâ€™s going to have to go completely off-script.
