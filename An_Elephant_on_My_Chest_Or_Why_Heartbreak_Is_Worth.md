Overview
&quot;A fun, thoughtful, and thought-provoking read from start to finish&quot; â€”Midwest Book Review
 
 With charmingly relaxed illustrations and text straight from the heart, this graphic work is dedicated to a topic that almost everyone knows.
 
 Have you been hit right in the heart? Is your heart crying? Do you feel like an elephant is sitting on your chest? The elephant is called heartbreak and can be big and heavy, small and light, very present or just a memory. This book wants to help you in a very horribleâ€”no, importantâ€” time.
 
 Spunky, humorous, tender, honest, (and at times angsty), young German author Lucia Zamolo talks about heartbreak with so much clarity that the book itself is like a cure for cloudy thoughts. No matter what age, this endearing rumination suddenly works better than any medicine.
