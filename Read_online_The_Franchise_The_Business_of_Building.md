Draft Day meets Burkeâ€™s Law in this incisive and entertaining behind-the-scenes look at hockeyâ€™s highest ranks.
 
 Why do some franchises consistently win, while others may never get to see their playersâ€™ names etched on the Cup? Why do some teams draft poorly and others draft all-star teams? Why do some teams just seem to know how to win?
 
 In The Franchise, The Athleticâ€™s Craig Custance delves into the stories about thepeople who make the biggest decisions in hockey. For more than three years, Custance travelled far and wide to connect with the inner circle of hockey, from the ownerâ€™s suite of the Carolina Hurricanes to a private championship ring ceremony with the Vegas Golden Knights to a country club for a breakdown of the Pittsburgh Penguins.He had frank conversations with new Leafsâ€™ GM Brad Treliving and former Leafsâ€™ GM Kyle Dubas, and discussed the revolution in women&amp;#039;s hockey with three-time Olympic medal winner and Devilsâ€™ executive Meghan Duggan.
 
 For fans of any stripe, there are stories behind memorable trades and the biggest free agent signings, and insights into how some of the most successful teams of the last two decades were built. There are never-been-told details about trade demands, a prominent hire that one general manager regretted immediately, and how one general manager risked his life to sign a player he thought could change the course of his NHL team.
 
 The Franchise will change the way you look at hockey. Custance shows that it all starts at the top, not on the ice. The players win, but itâ€™s the people up in the box who break down every aspect of their teams, execute the hard decisions, and make the magic happen. This is essential reading for every hockey fan who wants to get beyond the xâ€™s and oâ€™s in an absorbing testament to why teams win.
