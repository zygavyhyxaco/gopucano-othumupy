Montgavin Township will never be the same when one night changes the lives of six people. The course of their lives and the trajectory of the town sets them on a collision course for disaster. Charlie It was supposed to be a regular day out. Three couples celebrating the last days of summer. When tragedy struck. I thought I was going to marry her. Instead, I was burying her. I blamed the world for my pain. I buried it all. I became a man I didn&amp;#039;t even recognize. Autumn In a blink of an eye, everything changed. My best friend was gone, and I was responsible for it. I may not have been driving the truck, but I didn&amp;#039;t stop it. Escaping the town was the only thing I could do to survive the guilt. I thought I was strong enough to go back. I was wrong. One look from him and I knew I wasn&amp;#039;t welcome. But this is my home, and I wanted to come back. One night turned into more. But at the end of the day, I know he&amp;#039;ll never love me. Besides, we all have shattered dreams.
